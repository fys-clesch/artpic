artpic is an open source project for ray tracing.
It can be used to simulated scattering effects where geometrical effects are governing the system. Rays are treated as parts of plane electric waves with a complex amplitude and a polarisation.
So far, the only primitive is a sphere, but complex system can be composed of intersecting spheres.

The program relies on  freeglut, an OpenGL context handler to make it portable over a variety of operating systems, for 3D data visualisation.
OpenMP is used to trace rays through the system in parallel.
It is convenient to have gnuplot installed for exporting results to plots.
